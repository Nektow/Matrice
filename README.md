# Matrix
The goal is to create in a terminal a random number of characters in order to reproduce the matrix matrix.

We will then divide the work into three distinct parts:

I First of all, you have to create lists of the same size as the terminal which contains random characters.

II For this you will have to recover this information via the "rich" module

III Once this is done we will be able to add updates like fall speed, color etc...
